# Restocker

## Written By

Carla Patricia Vazquez, Christopher Michael Scott

## Description

Upon receiving a `pizza-order` request, Restocker aggregates the pizza ingredients from 
the pizzas contained in the `pizza-order` and checks the store’s stock to determine if 
there is sufficient stock to fill the order. If the current stock is insufficient, 
then a restock is performed for the deficient items so that the order can be filled. 
Once there is sufficient stock, this component decrements the store’s stock by the 
required amounts to fill the order, and the request is sent to the next component 
in the workflow, if one exists. The request is then sent to the next component in 
the workflow, if one exists. As a secondary function, this component scans the 
database at the end of every workflow day to check for items that might need to be 
restocked. If stock quantity for any item is below 10, then that item is restocked 
to a quantity of 50.

## Setup

Machine requirements:
* Python 3.8
* Docker

Package requirements:
* pipenv

Packages installed on pipenv virtual environment:
* quart
* jsonschema
* requests
* cassandra-driver

## Commands

* To build the image, use the following command in the folder containing the Dockerfile:
    ```
    ./build.sh
    ```

* To update the repository:
    ```
    sudo docker login
    docker push trishaire/restocker:tag
    ```
  * Where `tag` is the tag of restocker image.

* To create the service type the following command:
    ```
    docker service create --name restocker --network myNet --publish 5000:5000 --env CASS_DB=VIP_of_Cass_Service trishaire/restocker:tag
    ```
  * Where `VIP_of_Cass_Service` is the VIP of `myNet` overlay network, and `tag` is the tag of restocker image.

To run localy, ensure these environment variables `CASS_DB=0.0.0.0` and `FLASK_ENV=development` are set.

# Cass Component
Workflow 2, Component 2

## Written By
Carla Patricia Vazquez

## Description
This is the database component for both workflow mangers. It gets cql requests from several other components. It uses the official docker image for Cassandra as a base and loads our keyspace (database) on to it. It has a flask webserver to listen to workflow-request. when it recieves a PUT for a new workflow-request it inserts the store, its stock, and its associated delivery entities into the Cassandra database.

## Setup
Machine requirements:
* Python 2.7
* Docker

Package requirements:
* pipenv

Packages installed on pipenv virtual environment:
* cassandra-driver
* jsonschema
* Flask
* docker

## Commands

* To build the image:
  ```
  docker build --rm -t trishaire/cass:async path_to_c2_dockerfile
  ```
* To update the repository:
  ```
  sudo docker login
  docker push trishaire/cass:async
  ```
* To create cassandra service:
  ```
  docker service create --name cass --network myNet --publish 9042:9042 --publish 2000:2000 trishaire/cass:async
  ```
  * port 9042 is for access to the database
  * port 2000 is for the webserver

## Connecting to Cass from a python component

For connecting to cassandra:
```
docker service inspect cass
```
Copy the virtual ip of the cassandra service

pip install `cassandra-driver` or make a Dockerfile with this package.
Use the following python code to connect to cassandra.

```
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

cluster = Cluster(['vip of cassandra'])
session = cluster.connect()
session.execute(query)
```

#### Responses

| status code | status | meaning| returned |
|-------------|--------|--------| -------- |
| 200 | OK | Coordinates retreived | `coordinate` object |
| 404 | Not Found | Store does not exist, could not retrieve coordinates | N/A|

`coordinate`

| field | type |

### `PUT /workflow-requests/<storeId>`

#### Parameters

| parameter | type | required | description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| storeId | string - format uuid| true | the id of the store issuing the workflow request |

#### Body

Requires a [`workflow-request`](https://github.com/CPVazquez/CS6343Linear/blob/main/Workflows/WF2/Components/C1/src/workflow-request.schema.json) JSON object. 

`workflow-request`

#### Responses

| status code | status | meaning|
|-------------|--------|--------|
| 201 | Created | workflow was successfully created and inserted into the database |
| 400 | Bad Request | indicates the workflow-request was ill formatted |
| 409 | Conflict | a workflow already exists for the specified store, and thus a new one cannot be created |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity | json is valid, but the workflow-request specifies an unsupported workflow |

### `PUT /workflow-update/<storeId>`

#### Parameters

| parameter | type | required | description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| storeId | string - format uuid | true | the id of the store issuing the workflow request |

#### Body

| origin | string - format ip | N/A | true | The IP address of the host issuing the request |
| workflow-offset| integer | N/A | false | Generated by the workflow manager and passed to other components |

#### Responses

| status code | status | meaning|
|-------------|--------|--------|
| 200 | OK | The workflow was successfully updated |
| 400 | Bad Request | Indicates the `workflow-request` was ill-formatted |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity | Request JSON is valid, but the `workflow-request` specifies an unsupported workflow |

### `DELETE /workflow-requests/<storeId>`

#### Parameters

| parameter | type | required | description |

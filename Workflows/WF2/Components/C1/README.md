# Order Verifier Component

Workflow 2, Component 1

## Written By

Christopher Michael Scott

## Description

Upon receiving a order request, this component validates the received order against the `pizza-order` jsonschema.
If the `pizza-order` is valid, then the order will be passed to the next component in the workflow.
If the `pizza-order` is invalid, then the request is rejected by this component.

## Setup

Machine requirements:
* Python 3.8
* Docker

Package requirements:
* pipenv

Packages installed on pipenv virtual environment:
* quart
* jsonschema
* cassandra-driver
* requests

## Commands

* To build the image, use the following command in the folder containing the Dockerfile:
  ```
  ./build.sh
  ```

* To update Dockerhub repository:
  ```
  sudo docker login
  docker push trishaire/order-verifier:tag
  ```
  * Where `tag` is the tag of order-verifier image.

* To create the image as a service run the following command:
  ```
  docker service create --name order-verifier --network myNet --publish 1000:1000 --env CASS_DB=cass_service_vip trishaire/order-verifier:tag
  ```
  * Where `cass_service_vip` is the VIP of `myNet` overlay network and `tag` is the tag of order-verifier image.
